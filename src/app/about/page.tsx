            We are a group of gamers who believe that the current game industry,
            dominated by large corporations focused on profit, doesnt serve the
            true spirit of gaming. At CyberMoon, we position ourselves as a team
            that creates games from gamers, for gamers, with an open,
            step-by-step development process. Our mission is to bring engaging
            and meaningful experiences to players while remaining true to our
            passion for gaming.

            Our team, born from a shared dream, started as a group of strangers
            brought together through a Telegram channel. We united around the
            idea of building something special â€” games made with heart, not just
            for profit. All of us work without payment, driven solely by our
            love for games and our belief in creating something truly remarkable.
          </p>

            Currently, our team consists of 20 talented individuals, but that
            number is always growing as we continue to expand our reach and our
            vision. We are always open to new ideas and collaboration, so feel
            free to get in touch with us. Together, we can create the games
            that gamers deserve!
